## About This Repository
Robustly detecting people in low resolution CCTV is a very important problem in home and institutional security. Just a few years ago, there were no satisfactory solutions to achieve this goal. CNN makes object recognition trivial. However, a robust detection for very low resolution humans is yet to be implemented. The implementation in this repository gives a near perfect detection rate for distant, hiding, crawling, and partially obscured people shot by infrared cameras at night. In addition, this solution can be trained on a low end gaming computer.
