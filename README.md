## About This Repository
Robustly detecting people in low resolution CCTV is a very important problem in home and institutional security. Just a few years ago, there were no satisfactory solutions to achieve this goal. CNN makes object recognition trivial. However, detection in very low resolution camera is yet to be implemented. The solution implemented in this repository gives a near perfect detection rate for distant, hiding, crawling, and partially obscured people shot by an infrared camera at night.
